Rates of volunteering among the group of 50+ are much dispersed among countries. According to \citet{Oecd16}the rates ranged from above 30\% in the Netherlands, Irleand, Norwey, Switzerland to less than 10\% in Poland, Hungary, Greece, Portugal. Popularity of volunteering changes with age. In some countries - e.g. the Netherlands, France,Denmark and the UK  - the volunteering rates for those in the group of 50+ are higher than for the groups of younger people. In other countries - Norwey, Germany, Finland, Icleand, Switzerland  - the rates among elderly are higher than among the mid-age group (30-50) but they are lower than the rates for the group of 15-29. But there is also a group of european countries in which people in age 50 and above are involved in the volunteering less often than other people. These are the Central and East European countries (CEE) - Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Hungary - and  Southern European countries (SEC) - Spain and Italy \citet{Oecd16}.  Age and volunteering may be related in different ways. It is possible that country specificity emobodied in its history and culture is signicant part of explanation of variaty in the volunteering rates. Presumably, the motives for elderly to be involved in volunteering are different to those for younger people (\citet{wilson12}). \\

\textbf{Menchik and Weisbrod (1987)} propose to treat a volunteering either as an ordinary consumption good or as an investment good increasing an individual's income over time. \citet{haski09} noticed that elderly in comparison with young people are less motivated by carrer concerns and  more by social motive since volunteering give them  a  chance to participate in the usefull activities. In the "good conscience hypothesis" \textbf{(Freeman, 1997)} volunteering is something that people feel morally obligated to do when asked. This makes volunteering to be more like as an obligation than as a free personal choice that is rooted in an individual preferences. Volunteering having pure altruistic nature has more beneficial effect of volunteers than if it is the result of a social pressure. It is why we should expect weaker impact from it on subjective well-being if there are many volunteers around. Also, if there are many volunteering activites are conducted then some of them may have a limited value what adds to negative relation between the volunteering rates and change in wellbeing. \\

This leads us to distinguish between demand and supply factors for volunteering. The demand is mostly created by unmet demand for public goods and services. The supply depends on how people allocate their time to unpaid activities to improve her utility \citet{ziemek06}. This approach  suggests the positive relation between the degree of unsatisfactory supply of public good and services and the rates of formal volunteering. Inefficient markets and weak government are important determinants of formal volunteering popularity. This makes us to predict more volunteering in less developed countries where markets are inefficient and quality of government is low. However, this prediction seems to be false. For example, \textbf{Hank and Stuck (2008) and Siegrist and Wahrendorf (2009)}  give robust conclussion of the higher rates in Northern European countries and lower rates in Eastern and Southern Europe. The same pattern appears in previously citet OECD data (\citet{Oecd16}) as well as in  \citet{Oecd15} that shows the rates of formal volunteering range from 57.3\% in Norway to 17.7\% in Czechia. Variation in the rates is larger if we concentrate on the volunteering among people aged 50 and over. They range from 37.9\% in the Netherlands to as little as 3.2\% in Poland. The lower rates in less developed countries suggest a considerable role of supply factors and transaction costs that may be are responsible for unmet demand for volunteering services. These transaction costs may include transport difficulties, lack of information, perceptions of volunteering and lack of variety in the opportunities. The low rates mean also that those who overcome all costs must have strong altruistic attitude toward volunteering. This make them significantly different from non-volunteers.  \\

The low rates in less developed countries are worrying since the demographic changes and financial distress in retirement sector  will touch elderly in a especially adversely way. Quality of life of elderly who are likely to experience negative events due to health deterioration, reduction of income and smaller social contact network has become a major social issue. Volunteering may improve their QoL through engagement in a socially meaningful role and  gives meaning and purpose in life \textbf{(Greenfield and Marks, 2004; Prouteau and Wolff, 2008)}. The positive effect of volunteering by elderly are well known and commonly accepted, see:  \citet{morrow10}. Elderly seem to benefit more from volunteering than younger people \textbf{(Li and Ferraro, 2005; Van Willigen, 2000)}. \citet{jenkinson2013volunteering} surveyed forty experimental and cohort studies comparing the physical and mental health outcomes and mortality of a volunteering group to a non-volunteering group. They found that volunteering had favourable effects on depression, life satisfaction, wellbeing but not on physical health. Positive association between vounteering and subjective health was reported for example in  \citet{borgonovi08}, \cite{anderson14}, \cite{li06}, \cite{VanWilligen00}, \citet{detollenaere17}. \\ 

Helping others positive effects wellbeing of volunteering. Those engaged in such activity report higher scores for subjective well-being (\citet{haski09}, \citet{morrow2003}, \citep{thoits03}, \citep{whillans2016}). \citep{meier08} showed that volunteering led to increased life satisfaction in a longitudinal study in Germany. \citet{wilson12} in his review essay on volunteerism research  listed the benefits of volunteering for the volunteer. The list included: enchancement in mental health and protection against symptoms of mentall illness, lower levels of morbidity and mortality, socioeconomic benefits such as increase in chances of obtaining a better education and a better job. Positive effect of volunteering was also found in a study based on 30 case studies from 11 European countries (\citet{ehlers11}). It was stressed that volunteering of elderly people help them to build new relationships with other volunteers but also with those whom the helped. According to findings presented in the study volunteering helps regain a meaningful activities after some adverse events.   \\

Volunteering is beneficial for society ( \citet{Oecd15}, \cite{prouteau06}). It is considered to be a productive activity (\citet{hank09}). This is important becouse demographic changes together with progress in health care increase time while elderly  are in relatively good health while being on retirement. This creates a stock of unused labor among elderly that may be effectively used with benefit for volunteer and other members of a society.  This makes volunteering among elderly an intresting policy tool that may help to keep people in better health when they get older. The positive effect of volunteering has been recognized by many international organizations, also. In its 2001 recommendations the United Nations General Assembly identified volunteering as “an important component of any strategy aimed at poverty reduction, sustainable development, health, disaster prevention and overcoming social exclusion and discrimination” \textbf{(United Nations, 2001)}. In 2008, the European Parliament wrote about volunteering as “[the] most sustainable form of renewable energy” and encouraged Member States and regional and local authorities to “recognise [its] value in promoting social and economic cohesion” \textbf{(European Parliament, 2008)}. \\

This paper is closely related to the leading-edge question 3 in \citet{morrow10} thar was: "Under What Conditions Does Volunteering Enhance the Well-being of Older Volunteers?" and to the discussion line in \citet{haski09}. That exceptional empirical study included an extensive discussion of variations in volunteering rates according to main socio-economic variables as age, gender and employment status among people aged 50 or more in 12 Western and Southern European countries. As in the other studies it founded the highest rates of voluteering among elderly in Northern Europe and the lowest rates in Southern Europe. Apart from the confirmation of those previously discussed in the literature relations the paper includes the discussion of variation in impact of volunteering and wellbeing among the european conutries. It was found that \textit{"in countries which encourage volunteerism and where volunteering is a social norm, such as in the Northern European countries, the relation of volunteering and wellbeing was rather small. At the same time in countries where voulnteering was not so popular  a correlation between volunteering and three indicators of well-being (health, depression, and chances for longer life) were rather strong."}.  Our study is inspired by the above finding. Also, our results are related to a work by \citet{plagnol10} who claimed that "Individuals in countries with low rates of volunteering gain less from such activities – in terms of well-being – than those in countries with high rates of volunteering. Below, we discuss two hypothesis. \textbf{[to AOK: It is not good, it should be improved]} \\

\begin{enumerate}
\item H1: there are differences among countries how volunteering among elderly effects their Quality of Life 
\item H2: The impact of volunteering on QoL depends on its popularity in a country. The relation between the impact and the popularity is either decreasing in the rate or the relation is convex (inverted U).
\end{enumerate}

Our analysis extends \citet{haski09} in a few directions. Firstly, she used data collected in 2005 and 2006 in the first wave of Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). We use more current data collected in 2015 in the sixth wave of the SHARE survey. This allows us to include Central and Eastern European countries (CEE) into the analysis of volunteering among elderly that did not participated in the first wave of the SHARE survey. This extension is important since up to date the majority of the volunteering studies have been based on data from the United States or Western Europe (\citep{casiday08}). This is unfortunate since remarkable different life courses of Western and Eastern Europeans should lead to new and interesting insights (\textbf{Sokolowski 2001}). \citet{plagnol10} and the rates from the OECD publications citet above show that the rates of formal volunteering in Eastern and Central Europe are significantly lower then in Western Europe. Inclusion of those countries gives us more variation while studing the relation between its popularity and QoL. Secondly, in the first wave of the SHARE survey volunteering had to be identified by a question on activities conducted during last 4 weeks preceeding the interview. From the wave 4 the respondents are asked about such activites during last 12 months. This change has made the rates of volunteering in the SHARE much closer to the rates published by the OECD. Third, we measure an association between volunteering and QoL by the Kendall tau-b correlation coefficient while \citet{haski09} used the Pearson correlations. We test the statistical significance of the differences between the correlation coefficients what was not done in the previouse study. We think that this step is important since some differences are small and it is not obvious if they are statistically meaningfull. Fourthly, We use the CASP-12 index as a measure of QoL among elderly. The CASP-12 is a shorter version of the CASP-19 that was created as a measure of quality of life (QoL) in older ages.th measure is based on the needs-satisfaction theory \textbf{(Maslow, 1943; Doyal and Gough, 1991)}. QoL using the CASP is assessed depending on the level of implementation needs in four areas relevant to the positive experience of older age: the possibility of influencing one's own  surroundings (Control), autonomous decision-making (Autonomy), self-realization and taking pleasure in	surroundings (Control), autonomous decision-making (Autonomy), self-realization and taking pleasure in  life (Pleasure) (\cite{hyde03}). Finally, we extend the descriptive statistical analysis by a regresion analysis to control for possible confounding factors. We are also intrested in identifying a selection effect into volunteering that can explain, at least, partly the relation found in the descriptive analysis.  

\section{Data}

We use data from the wave 6 of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). The dataset provides wide range of information on the socio-economic status, health, and family relationships of people in age 50 or more in 18 European countries. The dataset includes information from 68 231 interviews (CAPI) conducted in 2015 in 18 countries - 11 countries were included in the wave 1 (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland) and 9 countries entered the survey later on (Czech Republic, Poland, Luxemburg,  Portugal, Slovenia, Estonia and Croatia). SHARE applies a concept of ex-ante harmonisation: there is one common generic questionnaire that is translated into the national languages using an internet based translation tool and processed automatically in a common CAPI instrument. In each participating country a probability sample was drawn. Due to different institutional conditions a uniform sampling design was impossible. For example, a simple random selection of households, from the central population register was used in in Denmark, while complex multistage design was applied in Greece. The  household level response rate ranged from 30.3\% in Luxemburg to 69.3\% in Greece. \citet{bergmann17} \\
In the paper we consider the formal volunteering that is conducted within a formal organisational structure, is self-governing, is not profit distributing and is independent of government. We do not consider the informal volunteering such as providing unpaid help to a friend or neighbour. The lengthy and detailed discussion of challenges to measuring volunteering can be find in \citet{salomon2017}. Volunteering is identified through respondent's answer to a question about activities done in 12 months preceeding the survey. We consider as a volunteer a person who gave a positive answer to a question: "Have you done any of these activities in the last month: Done voluntary or charity work."  Our definition of the volunteering is consistent with the UN \footnote{United Nations Volunteers Programme: Preparatory Committee for the Special Session of the General Assembly on the implementation of the outcome of the world summit for social development and further initiatives. Volunteering and social development. A/AC.253/16/Add.7. United Nations; 2000.} and the OECD approaches in \citet{Oecd15} and \citet{Oecd16}. The same approach was previously used in \citet{haski09}. Comparison of different rates are presented below. \\

%%%% END: TABLE

The rates for the wave 1 are lower than those for the wave 5 and the wave 6. Ther is no much difference between the last two columns.  The rates for  the Central and East European countries are among the lowest ones.  For Poland we get the rate below 4\%. The rates for Hungary, Estonia and Czech Republic are slightly bigger but they are below 9\%. Slovenia is the only country with the rate above 10\% among formery centrally-planned economies. The rates in CEEs are on levels similar to observed in Southern Europe - Greece (7\%), Spain (6\%), Italy (below 12\%), Portugal (below 10\%).  The country pattern observed in Table \ref{Rates} fits well to the results know previously in the literature. First of all, there is a large variation in rates. Secondly,  the highest rates are seen for  Northern and Western European countries - the Netherlands (close to 50\%), Denmark, Switzerland and Belgium (around 30\%) and the lowest rates in Eastern and Southern Europe. \\
The low rates in Southern and Eastern Europe may be partly due to tight family bonds in these countries and low welfare services. Elderly in Southern and Eastern European countries more often take care of grandchildren what limits their possibility to be involved in formal volunteerig \textbf{(Dykstra and Fokkema, 2011; Hank, 2007; Myck on grandfathers)}. Experience of  enforced volunteering  in former socialistic countries where people were required to devote their time for social, cultural and political causes may be another couse of low rates in Eastern Europe \textbf{(Kuti,2004; Anheier and Salamon, 1999, p.44).} The experiance of forced volunteering  may lower the desire to provide assistance to others by making the “volunteering became obsolete” for the current elderly. On the other hand, the rates in some formerly socialistic countries - Czech Rep., Estonia or Slovenia - are currently higher than in Southern Europe. This makes us to speculate that historical reasons are not the main obstacles to low rates in those countries. Even if some people have unpleasant memories of volunteering in the past there are more general couses such as economic development that explain diversity in the rates of volunteering. We belive that an economic progress in Central and Eastern Europe that have been observed since the collapse of the communism may increase propenisty to volunteering among elderly. \\
The average levels of quality of life among volunteers are higher than among nonvolunteers in all countries. The highest values of casp are for volunteers in Denmark, Austria and Switzerland. The lowest values for non-volunteers in Greece, Portugal and Italy.

The means in Eastern European countries (Poland, Estonia, Czech Republic) are higher than in Southern European for both volunteers and non-voluteers. The distributions of casp for volunteers and nonvolunteers show higher concentration of large values among volunteers (Appendix). The differences in the means decreas in the volunteering rate.  The differences in  Denmark, Switzerland, Belgium and Germany are less then 1.0. In countries where the rates are low the differences are above 1.5 - in Poland it is 2.7, in Spain 1.8, in Greece 1.7 and in Estonia 2.6. The negative relation suggests that "more volunteers in a country makes smaller increase in a volunteer wellbeing". 

Figure \ref{fig:casp} shows bigger heterogenity of the rates among the low rate countries. In Czech Republic, Portugal and Estonia the rates are similar but the absolute differences in the means are significantly different. At the same time the rates in Czech Republic and Slovenia are lower than in France, Germany, Luxemburg but the differences in means are at similar levels in all these countries. This comparison suggests that the large rates are associated with smaller impact on wellbeing what is consistent with findings in \citet{haski09} and \citet{plagnol10}. It seems that country specific factors do not play significance role among those countries. Whatever the rate is the impact of volunteering on average QoL is the same. Larger heteregenity  among the low rate countries suggests bigger role of country specific factors. Low popularity of volunteering exists with large range of differences in casp. The possible explanation is that in highly developed countries formal volunteering is well organized with the efficient help from governmant but many tasks done by volunteers are not of high importance. In less developed countries countries there more barriers what lowers supply of volunteers but the realized tasks are truly relevant. This makes volunteers to have strong feelings of being involved in necessary and highly valued activities. However it does not explain why there is so large heterogenity among the low rate countries.   

%\textbf{health} \\
%We use similar measure of subjective health to the one used in Haski(2009). This is the self-perceived health variable with the respondents that range from "very bad" to "very good". Subjective health is also higer in more developed countries. In this case people from Southern European countries repored on average highher levels than those from Eastern Europe. The lowes mean values were found for Poland, Estonia, Croatia, Slovenia, Czech Rep. and in Portugal.


\section{Results}

In this part we use the Kendall's tau-b correlation coefficient to investigate the association between the the quality of life index (casp) and involvment in volunteering. The Kendall's correlation coefficient may be used for either ordinal or interval data what makes it the better measure than the Pearson correlation coefficient that may be used only for interval data. Additionally, the Kendall's tau is less sensitive to outliers  \citet{khamis08}. The Kendall's correlation coefficients range from 15.4\% (Isreal) to 3.3\% (Sweden) suggesting a non-linear association between volunteering and QoL. The values of Kendall's tau-b correlation coefficients and the Pearson correlations coefficients from \citet{haski09} are compared below:

 The significance tests confirm concave relation between the effect of volunteering on QoL and values of the volunteering rate. The p-values for the tests are given in the Appndix.  The point estimate for tau-b for Germany (0.109) is not statistically different to the estimate for Slovenia (0.106), Spain, Belgium, Portugal, Poland, Switzerland, Croatia and Greece (0.082). This homogenouse group in dimension of the impact is highly heterogenouse in dimension of the rate of volunteering. At the same time the tau-b for Estonia (0.141) is statistically different to the tau-b estimates in Slovenia (0.106), Poland(0.090) and Czech Republic (0.053) but it is the same as in France, Luxemburg and Austria. The tests confirm the finding in \citet{haski09} about non-linear pattern of associations between  the rate of volunteering and its impact on wellbeing. Figure \ref{fig:taub} shows that our approach based on the tau-b measure and casp index makes that finding even more convincing. \citet{haski09} discussed two explanations why concavity of the realtion betweem the volunteering rate and its impact on wellbeing. The first one stress differences in motives for volunteering according to the economic developmnent of a country. In highly developed countries with the strong welfare system volunteering is a part of a social norm and it is not always related to solving real problems. In less developed countries with weaker welfare state people are involved in volunteering only becouse their altruistic preferences without feeling any social pressure. That is why they more often feel the sense of fullfilment  The second explanation is based on the Social Origins Theory \textbf{(Salamon and Anheier 1998) }. This argument states that the state through its genorouse social welfare policy satisfies demand for most social needs efficiently constraining supply of volunteering by non-govermental organizations. This crowding out effect does not exist in countries with less genorouse social welfare policy. In those countries volunteers are usually involved in solving the important social problems what increases their subjective wellbeing. Both arguments help to understand why volunteering can have a limited impact on wellbeing in reach countries. However, they do not explain why that impact may also be low in less developed countries. \textbf{[AOK: something is missing here. It would be nice to have some discussion on reasons why the association may be low when the rate is low. Any idea ?]} \\

However, it is possible that the low associations observed in these countries are due to selection into volunteering people who \textbf{[i tak sa zadowolni, nawet bez wolonariatu]}. Table 3 presents descriptives statistics for volunteers and non-volunteers together with the significance tests for the differences in means.  \\

Both groups are different in their socio-economic characteristics. In all countries volunteers have better formal education (higher average number of years of education). Everywhere the shares of people with tertiary education are higher among volunteers, while the shares of people with primary education are lower. In countries with low volunteering the differences in a education structure are larger. In Poland the ratio of a share of people with a tertiary  education among volunteers over a share of such people among non-volunteers is 3.49. The respective ratios for Spain, Czech Republic, Estonia are: 2.77, 2.29 and 1.99, while for for Denmark it is 1.23, for Belgium 1.45, and for Switzerland it is 1.54. 

Differences in average age more diverse among countries. The means are  not statistically different  in Austria and in Denmark among Western European countries. In other countries from that group volunteers are younger  on average than non-volunteers. The exception is Sweden where volunteers are older. The histograms reveal in Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany,Switzerland and Luxemberg there are noticebly larger shares of volunteers in the age group of 65-70. In Greece and Portugal average ages in both gropus are not statistically different. In Isreal volunteers are older while in Spain and Italy they are younger on average than non-volunteers. In Czech Republic the averages are not significantly different while in Poland, Estonia and Slovenia volunteers are younger. The differences in average age in these countries are above 2 years what seems to be larger differences than in countries from other groups. In Poland and Estonia there are larger shares of people in the age group 50-55 among volunteers.  In Slovenija the difference is due to smaller share of volunteers older then 70 years. \textbf{[Comment ?]}

In many countries the shares of women and men among volunteers and non-volunteers are the same. In France and Germany there are more males involved in voluntering while in Switzerland the share of women among volunteers is larger. In Grecee, Italy and Spain women are more often involved in volunteering than man. There are no gender effect on volunteering in the CEE countries.Volunteers have better subjective health.  In Table \ref{DescT0} we found that smaller fraction of volunteers declare at most fair subjective health. Only in Switzerland, Greece, Isreal and in Portugal the fractions are the same.  Our measure of income takes into account differences in purchesing power parities and economy of scale due to a number of people living in a household. We apply the modifed OECD scale to control for decreasing living cost per person. We find no clear pattern between average income and volunteering. The differences in means are signifcant for Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Luxemburg, Isreal, Italy and Estonia. In all countries except Sweden average income among volunteers were higher than among non-volunteers. Conditional distributions of equivalized income (Appendix) present a much richer picture. In all Southern and Eastern European countries there are more people with high income among volunteers than among non-volunteers. In  Western Europe it is observed only for  Austria, Belgium, France, Germany. Sweden presents a unique case - there are more people with low income among volunteers. The distributions for Germany and Luxemburg reveal another interesting phenomenon. Namely, there is a small group of very rich people among non-volunteers that does not exist among volunteers.

Volunteers and volunteers differ according to socio-economic characteristics. Simple logit models confirm this. For each country education is significant variable explaining selection into volunteering. In majority of countries there is a selection according to age and subjective health, also.

The Pearson's as well as the Kendall's correlation coefficients do not control for confounding socio-economic variables. That is why the previously discussed relation between popularity of volunteering and its impact on QoL may give us the false picture. 
 
\subsection*{Volunteering and casp (regression analysis)}

We have shown that volunteers and non-volunteers differ in their  socio-economic characteristics in ways specific for each conutry.  Below we analyze how those differences influence the the impact of volunteering on QoL. We use two specification. First we pool all data into the one model. Then we estimates separate models for each country. The second approach assumes lack of the universal relation for all countries due to the strong country effects that  encompasses the differences in history, cultural factors and institutions that are seen as the unique characteristic of a country. Here, for each country we need to estimate the separate model. This is consistent with findings that "contextual factors, such as a country’s historical background or institutions, determine levels of volunteering to a large extent" (\citet{plagnol10}).

  \begin{eqnarray}
	casp_{i,c}= \alpha_{c}+ \beta_{0c}*v_{i,c} + \beta_{1c}*(v_{i,c}*gdp_{i,c})+ \beta_{2c}*(v_{i,c}*gdp_{i,c}^{2}) + \gamma_{c}*Z_{i,c} + \epsilon_{i,c}
 \end{eqnarray}

where $v_{i,c}$ is a binary variable equal to 1 if a person i from a country c is involved in  volunteering  and gdp is a country average gdp per capita expressed in purchasing power parity in years X-Y. Matrix $Z_{i,c}$ includes controls - age, gender, education, an equivalized houseshold level income in purchasing parity units, subjective health, household size, number of grandchildren.
Separate models for each country are:

  \begin{eqnarray}
	casp_{i,c}= \alpha_{c}+ \beta_{0c}*v_{i,c} + \gamma_{c}*Z_{i,c} + \epsilon_{i,c}

Volunteering has a positive impact on QoL regardles the approach has been chosen. The multilevel model estimated is 0.91 and is it statistically significant at the level less than 1\%. The fixed effect approach estimates range from 0.28 for Denmark to 1.84 for Italy. All coefficients are significant except the one for Luxemburg. The high point estimates are for the low rate countries such as: Greece, Italy, Spian, Isreal, Poland, Estonia. The low estimates are for: Denmark, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland and Czech Republic. \\

Estimates on the control socio-economics variables have expected signs. Better subjective health and higher income increase QoL. Age is positively related to QoL in rich countries - Belgium, Danmark, Germany, Isreal, Luxemburg - and negatively in Austria, Greece, Spain, Sweden, Czech Rep.,  Slovenia, Estonia. In Poland, Switzerland, Portugal, France, Italy the age variable has appeared to be insignificant. In the random effect approach the age effect  showed up with the minus sign. The female effect turned out to have different directions among the analysed countries, also.  It has shown higher impact for women in two Scandinavic countries - Denmark and Sweden - and in Estonia. Average effect from the random effect approach suggests lower impact for women. In majority of countries education showed positive effect on QoL. Only in Austria, Denmark, Sweden we get statistically significant negative values. Income has either positive effect or it has no effect on QoL. \\

The results are consistent with the previouse finding on nonlinear effect of economic development on an impact of volunteering on QoL. We find higher effect in Italy, Greece, Isreal than in Poland, Denmark and Switzerland. This  is consistent with \citet{haski09} and with unconditional analysis with the Kendall's correlations. This is not very suprising since we do not control for differences in within group characteristics. So far, we know that volunteers have higher QoL but we do not know whether it is becouse they are active as volunteers or becouse they are generally have higher QoL. Positive estmiates on volunteering variable suggests that volunteering does have positive impact on QoL. In order to see how strong is that effect and whether it is different among countries we apply Juhn-Murphy-Pierce decomposition.

%Controlling for age, gender, education, economic development of a country and household's income generally decreases an impact of volunteering in QoL. The fixed effect approach suggests especially significant effect of a selection into volunteering in Poland and Estonia. Selection is also important in highly developed countries like Luxemburg and France. The selection effect seems to have smaller role in Italy, Greece, Spain, Portugal and Isreal. In Sweden the selection plays a minor role what has been expected after comparing the socio-economic characteristics of volunteers and non-volunteers. It is intresting that in two formerly socialistic countries - Poland and Estonia - selection into volunteering is more important than in Southern Europe. It suggests that nowdays volunteering of elderly in CEE coutries adds reltively less to average QoL  than in Southern Europe. It may be becouse volunteers in CEEs are more often selected from those who had high level of QoL even without the volunteering. This may be realted to weak infrastruture for volunteering in these countries what, as was pointed in \citet{plagnol10}, causes that only highly motivated individuals engage in voluntary activities. \\ 


% It seems that in countries where the rates of volunteering are low - Poland, Spain, Greece, Estonia - the large difference in the levels of QoL are in large part due to the differences in characteristics. This means that volunteers had had higher QoL than non-volunteers even if they would not be involved in volunteering. The role of unobserved characteristics is noticebly important in Poland. In Italy and Isreal the volunteering effect explains larger part of the differences in QoL than in other countries. The volunteering effect is weak among countries with the large rates of volunteering except Denmark. The Danish effect is larger than the effects in Switzeralnd, Belgium, Luxemburg, Germany, France and Austria. Its absolute level is simialar to the levels in four countries with the smallest rates. \\
   
 
\section{Discussion}

We applied three empirical methods to discuss an association of volunteering with QoL. Firstly, we calculated the Kendall tau-b correlation coefficients and compared  our results with those discussed in \citet{haski09}. Then, we applied a multivariate linear approach to QoL with a set of controls for socio-economic characteristics as exogenouse variables. We estimated the model with two different specifications -  as the fixed effect model and as the random effect one.\\

We were interested in the two issues in this study: a) whether the relation between volunteering rates for elderly and QoL differ according to countires and b) how that relation changes in the volunteering rates. We found the support for our first hypothesis regardless of the method used. The results of the Kendall tau-b correlation analysis as well as the esimates of a multivariate liner regression models showed higher QoL among volunteers. They showed different associatin between volunteering and QoL according to countries, too. This variation between countries was observed even after controling for socio-demographic characteristics such as age, education, gender and income. Our results are in line with the previouse studies (\citet{haski09}, \citet{plagnol10}). The multivariate approach reveals that part of an unconditional correlation between volunteering and QoL may be explained by the selection of people into the voluntareeing sector. Not taking into account difefrences in characteristics between volunteers and non-volunteers leads to the overestimation of the impact of voluntering on QoL since volunteers are recruited from people whose characteristics are positivly correlated with QoL. Our study showed that the significance of selection effect differs according to countries. Despite that, the volunteering effect on QoL is still quite strongly diverse according to countries even after controlling for possible effect due to selection. \\

We did not find the clear answer for the second question. Both regression approaches suggested the weaker volunteering effect in countries with high rates. This conlusion seems to be robust in all applied methods. Conclussions differ in regard of countries with the low volunteering rates.The fixed effect approach, that assumes significant role for country specific cultural and historical factors, showed stronger effect in those countries than in the first group.This is consistent with the statment in \citet{plagnol10} that stress the role of selection into the volunteering sector - " ... volunteers in countries with a low frequency of volunteering displayed higher values on several of the wellbeing measures than those in other countries. (...) in countries where volunteering is generally less common, those who do participate in formal or informal volunteering have the highest levels of well-being. It may be that in these countries, only those who are most likely to benefit from volunteering actually volunteer". Unfortunately the fixed effect approah does not allow us to predict what would be the effect of increasing popularity of volunteering in these countries on the basis of the results for other countries. But some speculative conclussion may be rised from the random effect approach that assumes the common model for all countries. The result of that approach suggests the strongest association between voluntering and QoL among countries with the mid-range volunteering rates. Hence, we allow that increasing the popularity of volunteering in countries where the current rates are low may decrease in averege impact of it on QoL but we do not expect this to be significance in size.  \\    

\textit{The development of volunteer programs that maximize outcomes requires better understanding of the mechanisms through which this particular activity produces positive effects on older adults(...) A clearer understanding about differential effects of volunteering could guide program development around targeted recruitment to increase health outcomes as well as provide insights into the causal relationship between volunteering and health. (...) I
n sum, there is a general understanding about positive effects of volunteering on older adults. We need more clarity about specific conditions of volunteering that produce these positive effects. At this point, it appears that less advantaged older adults, in terms of social, economic, and health resources, benefit more from volunteering, but we do not have enough evidence to advocate for targeting certain groups to maximize volunteer outcomes. There is little specific research on program features that maximize outcomes. Such research would clearly inform the development of interventions that are most beneficial to older adults. Ultimately, researchers need to vary conditions of the volunteer experience (the amount and type of work, etc.) but this experimental methodology will be very challenging. (...) Clearly, selection is an issue in
this work, as older adults with higher levels of well-being volunteer. The work of Thoits and Hewitt (2001),
Li and Ferraro (2005), and Hao (2008) documented that
both forces operate—that is, older adults with higher levels of well-being volunteer and also experience positive effects because of volunteer participation. : Morrow-Howell 2010}.


We belive that one issue in regard of the relation between volunteering and QoL rised in the study needs the speciall attantion. This study is built up on the previous research discussed in \citet{haski09}. Our study extends it by considering Central and Eastern European countries. The volunteering rates are low in all these countries. This made the sample of countries more diverse. We showed that the shares of volunteers in the age group of 50-65 in Poland, Estonia and Slovenia are rather high. The shares of older elderly - in age 70+ - in those countries are low. All of the above findings - low volunteering rates and age structure - may be related to age cohort effects. Particpants of the SHARE survey analysed in the study had their working career years during the socialistic regime. This might have two negative consequences on their wilingness to paricipate in volunteering. First, volunteering can badly associate them. Secondly, they are in bad health due to poor working conditions in the past (Wahrendorf, 2016). These factors make the population of elderly in CCE in the studied sample significantly different to their peers (równieśnicy) in other european countries. But we may assume that they are much different to future elderly in CEE whose will be much like their peers from Western Europe. All of these suggests that we may be in favor of the fixed effect approach for the current analysis that's goal is to describe differences among countries. At the same time we may prefer  the random effect model when we are looking for predictioni how volunteering will influence QoL in countries where the current rates are low. \\

It is unfortunate that the volunteering is not very popular among elderly in less developed European countries. However if our understanding of the selection into volunteering is correct we should expect increase in the rates even without any special public policy.
