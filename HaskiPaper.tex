Volunteering changes with age not only in its popularity but also in its characteristics. The motives are also presumably different (\citet{wilson12} dodac inne).  From a  economic perspective one may distinguish demand for volunteering that is created by unmet demand for public goods and services and supply of volunteering that depends on how  a person allocate her or his time to unpaid activities to improve her utility \citet{ziemek06}. Economic reasoning  suggests that volunteering should be related to unsatisfactory level of supply of public good and services  that are not delivered by either the market or the government. This implies that unpaid work at the form of volunteering should be more popular in less developed countries where markets are inefficient and quality of goverment is low. However, this prediction is false and volunteering is rather positively  related to the degree of economic development (\citet{Oecd15},Figure 5.1. Participation rates in formal volunteering). Participation rates in formal volunteering range from 57.3\% in Norway to 17.7\% in Czechia. If concentrate on people aged 50 and over in Europe variation in the rates is even larger. It ranges from 37.9\% in the Netherlands to as little as 3.2\% in Poland (\citet{Oecd15}) \footnote{Fig 5.8 Participation rates in formal volunteering among people aged 50 and over in European countries, data are based on the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), wave 4(2015)} \\ 

Higher rates of volunteering in  highly developed countries are possibly due to the role of supply factors and public policy in overcoming the barriers to volunteering such as transport difficulties, lack of information, perceptions of volunteering and lack of variety in the opportunities. Volunteering among elderly can play important role in susteining well-being of elderly. Volunteering is beneficial for society (LIT: \citet{Oecd15}, \cite{prouteau06}, ... ). Often it is labelled "a productive activity" (\citet{hank09}). But it also benefits volunteers. \citet{jenkinson2013volunteering} surveyed forty experimental and cohort studies comparing the physical and mental health outcomes and mortality of a volunteering group to a non-volunteering group and they found that volunteering had favourable effects on depression, life satisfaction, wellbeing but not on physical health. Positive association between vounteering and subjective health was reported in many studies (e.g. \citet{borgonovi08}, (\cite{anderson14}, \cite{li06}, \cite{VanWilligen00}, Japonka,  \citet{detollenaere17}). \\

Quality of life  of elderly has become a major social issue since they are most
likely to experience negative events. \textbf{--not sure what that meant, either
leaborate or paraphraze or drop--i guess you meant that elderly are dying and so unhappy,but so what thats obvious and isnt relevant anyway,id just drop it}
The assessment of elderly QoL faces is particularly challenging.\textbf{--why?} In response to this a measure of QoL for individuals aged 65 to 75, the so-called CASP-19, based on the needs-satisfaction theory (Maslow, 1943; Doyal and Gough, 1991 has been proposed. This scale includes 19 Likert-type items reflecting four different dimensions of QoL: Control, Autonomy, Self-realization, and Pleasure. A shorter version with 12 items, the so-called CASP-12, was proposed and tested in (Wiggins et al., 2008). A 12-item version of the CASP used in the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) differs from the one suggested in Wiggins(2008). A SPAIN paper supports a multidimensional model for the CASP–12 composed by three factors and it concludes has potential to be used as a multidimensional tool to assess QoL in older people. \\

There is  agreement in the literature on positive effects on volunteering -
those active in such activity report better health and higher scores for
subjective well-being (\citet{haski09}, \citet{morrow2003}, \citep{thoits03},
\citep{whillans2016}). \citep{meier08} showed that volunteering led to increased
life satisfaction in a longitudinal study in Germany. That is why one also
should expect positive relationship between volunteering and qulity of life. It is
suprising, at least for us, that the relationship between volunteering and  QoL
is studied rarely. \citet{haski09} is one of the few studies, and the present
study is specifically motivated by \citet{haski09}. \citet{haski09} used data
collected in 2005 and 2006 in the first wave of Survey of Health, Ageing and
Retirement in Europe (SHARE). The paper includes an extensive discussion of
variations in volunteering rates according to main socio-economic variables as
age, gender and employment status among people aged 50 or more in 12 Western and
Southern European countries. It finds positive relationship between volunteering and
physical and psychological well-being and that volunteering rates differes
according to country  with the highest rates in Northern Europe and the lowest
rates in Southern Europe.  But the paper introduces a puzzle:  \textit{"in countries which encourage volunteerism and where volunteering is a social norm, such as in the Northern European countries, the relationship of volunteering and wellbeing was rather small. At the same in countries where voulnteering was not so popular  a correlation between volunteering and three indicators of well-being (health, depression, and chances for longer life) were rather strong."}. This was unexpected result. \\

This paper extends the study by \citet{haski09} in a few directions. Firstly, we
use data collected in 2015 in the sixth wave of the SHARE survey, which allows
us to add some Central and Eastern European countries (CEE) into the analysis
(they were not included in the first wave of the survey).  \citep{casiday08}
noted that the majority of the studies in this area were based on data from the
United States. Remarkable different life experiences of people from Western
Europe and those from Central Europe make new insights into volunteering of
population of 50+ possible.  Secondly, in the first wave of the SHARE survey
volunteering was identified through a question on activities conducted during
last 4 weeks before the interview. As we show in the paper this made the rates
of volunteering to be signicantly different to the rates published by the
OECD. Starting from the wave 4 of the SHARE the data are based on activities
conducted during 12 months preceding the interview. This change has made the
volunteering rates in the SHARE more like the statistics from other sources.
Third, association between volunteering and health or life satisfaction is
measured in the paper by the Kendall tau coefficient while \citet{haski09} used
the Pearson correlations. We also test statistical significance of differences
in the correlations coefficients between countries,  which was not done in \citet{haski09}.  Since differences in the correlation coefficients are often quite small it is not obvious if a given difference is really meaningfull. Also, we use different measures of life satisfaction (quality of life) and health to ones used in \citet{haski09}. Finally, we apply a multilevel regresion analysis to control for possible confounders.  \\

Following \citet{haski09} we expect that impact from volunteering on well-being
differs among countries and its strength depends on popularity of
volunteering. We expect that reation to be negative or convex (inverted U):  in
countries with the high or low rates of volunteering effect on well-being is lower than in countries with the middle rate. It is not obvious, however, how important  volunteering might be in countries where it is not popular. Our results can have important practical consequences. Population aging in Europe asks for new policy tools that may be used to keep elderly wellbeing on decent levels. Volunteerism may be an interesting option for elderly and should be considered as a labor supply tool for productive ageing. 
 


\section{Data}

\textbf{About SHARE} \\
We use from the 2015 Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). The dataset provides wide range of information on the socio-economic status, health, and family relationships of people in age 50 or more in XY European countries. The wave 6 used in the research is based on XXXXX interviews (CAPI) in 12 countries that were included in the wave 1 (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and The Netherlands) and 9 countries that entered the survey later on (Czech Republic, Poland, Ireland, Luxembur, Hungary, Portugal, Slovenija, Estonia and Croatia). Over 68 000 elderly  participated in the survey. SHARE applies a concept of ex-ante harmonisation: there is one common generic questionnaire that is translated into the national languages using an internet based translation tool and processed automatically in a common CAPI instrument. \\

\textbf{Sampling} \\
Probability samples were drawn in each participating country. Due to different institutional conditions a uniform sampling design was impossible. For example, a simple random selection of
households, from the central population register was used in in Denmark, while complex multistage design was applied in Greece. The weighted average household response rate was
XX\%, and ranged from XX\% in CC to 74\% in CC. 


\textbf{volunteering} \\
Volunteering differently influences life satisfaction over life course. Willigen (2000) notices that "...elderly experience greater positive changes in their perceived health than did younger adult volunteer".

Volunteering is identified solely on a basis of respondent's declaration about activities conducting in last 12 months. The question was phrased: "Have you done any of these activities in the last month: Done voluntary or charity work." The variable was recoded into a binary variable with the value one for those indicating that activity. Volunteering considered in the study does not include a help given to close family members. This understanding of the volunteering is consistent with the UN definition \footnote{United Nations Volunteers Programme: Preparatory Committee for the Special Session of the General Assembly on the implementation of the outcome of the world summit for social development and further initiatives. Volunteering and social development. A/AC.253/16/Add.7. United Nations; 2000.}. However, one needs to remember that our volunteering measure is not free of possibility of being condaminated by a measurement error. 

Another widely accepted feature of formal volunteerism is that, it takes place within a formal organisational structure, is self-governing, is not profit distributing (?) and is independent of government (Salamon and Sokolowski 2001). Another way of defining voluteering is "informal" volunteering conducted outside of the structures of a voluntary organisation such as providing unpaid help to a friend or neighbour. Informal volunteering includes activities that are very heterogeneous. We are aware that informal and formal volunteering may have very different impact on individuals well being. In the study we include only formal volunteering. Informal is identified in separate question (check to be sure)

\textbf{Quality of life, life satisfaction, CASP} \\
A measure of life satisfaction use in the paper differs from the one applied in Haski(2009). We use the CASP-12 index described in \cite{hyde03}. The CASP-12 is a shorter version of the CASP-19, a measure of quality of life (QoL) in older ages. The CASP-19 draws upon the “Theory of Human Need” and has four dimensions: Control, Autonomy, Self-realization and Pleasure \citep{borrat15}.\\

In the SHARE survey a quality of life is 
In the case of the SHARE study, general assessments of the quality of life of the respondents are collected at
using two approaches. On the one hand, the respondents are asked about the subjective assessment of life satisfaction on a scale from 0 to 10,
and on the other, the reflection of the quality of life assessment is based on 12 questions from the so-called CASP kit, specially developed for the needs
examining the quality of life of people in the early stages of old age (in Annex 1.1 to this chapter is the full wording of the questions
CASP kit). Although the advantage of this first approach is clarity and simplicity of assessments, the results obtained using
the latter are less exposed to arbitrariness of assessments and are less dependent on highly influential variables
on the overall satisfaction rating, such as mood or season (White, 2007). Researching the quality of life in the form of a CASP-12 question set
is present in SHARE from the first edition of the project. As part of CASP, quality of life is assessed depending on the level of implementation
needs in areas relevant to the positive experience of older age (Hyde et al., 2003): the possibility of influencing one's own
surroundings (Control), autonomous decision-making (Autonomy), self-realization and taking pleasure in
life (Pleasure). Based on previous works (eg Laslett, 1996), the literature indicates that after leaving the active life
retirement increases personal independence and new opportunities for active participation in social life,
following your own desires and developing your interests.
By creating CASP's measure, its authors were based on Maslow's theory of needs (1968), assuming that people do not only care about
simple satisfaction of basic needs and survival, but consistently strive to meet higher needs like happiness
or self-esteem. Maspl's considerations were compared with the view presented in the article by Doyal and Gough
(1991) that the priority of physiological needs over social may be dependent on circumstances, as an example given by elderly people
saving on heating to buy Christmas presents for grandchildren. From Maslow, the authors adapt one more important view
- that people share a universal set of needs, which translates into measurable level of satisfaction of needs and the possibility
comparing this level for different people. 



\textbf{health} \\
We use similar measure of subjective health to the one used in Haski(2009). This is the self-perceived health variable with the respondents that range from "very bad" to "very good". Subjective health is also higer in more developed countries. In this case people from Southern European countries repored on average highher levels than those from Eastern Europe. The lowes mean values were found for Poland, Estonia, Croatia, Slovenia, Czech Rep. and in Portugal.

\section{Results}

\subsection*{Volunteering rates for elderly in Europe}

The way how a question on volunteering was formulated in the SHARE had
significant impact on levels of the rates. Table \ref{OECDSHARE}  compares the rates from Haski (2009) and the rates calculated using the wave 6 with the rates reported in OECD(2016).

      \label{OECDSHARE} 
\end{spacing}
%%%% END: TABLE

The rates in the wave 6 are much more like the rates published by the OECD than the rates from the wave 1. Changes in the question made volunteering rates in the SHARE more similar to those published by the OECD using the Gallup data. The rates from the wave 6 exceeds those from the wave 1 except Sweden (18\% vs. 15\%).  For example, for Switzerland the rate is almost 30\%, while previously it was 15\%. For Germany the rate changed from 17\% to almost 25\%. The rates in countries that did not particpated in the wave 1 are low - Poland 3.43\%, Czech Republic 8.87\%, Estonia 8.75\%, Portugal 9.55\%, Slovenia 12.15\%. Only for Luxemburg the rate is high - 24.75\%. Similar to previous studies , the results show significant country variation in volunteering rates. The pattern found in the SHARE data is well know in literature - the highest rates are in Northern and Western Europe:  Denmark (31.4\%), Switzerland (29.5\%) and Belgium (26.6\%), and the lowest rates are in Eastern and Southern Europe: Poland (3.4\%), Spain (6.3\%), Greece (7.0\%) and Czech Republic (8.9\% [Lit.]. It is intresting that the scores in formerly centrally-planned economies such as Poland, Czech Rep., Estonia or Croatia are higher than in Southern Europe. We may speculate that an economic progress in Eastern and Central Europe that have been observed since the collapse of the communism is  one explanation. The range of the values from above 30\% to as little above 3\% suggest other explanations than simple differences in demographic structure.   Despite that levels published by the OECD and those calculated from the SHARE data are different the geographical pattern in which low values are in Southern and Central Europe and high values re in  Western and Northern Europe is consistent. \footnote{Results for Sweden \textit{are somehow couterintuitive and difficut to interpret. Lower values in the wave 6 than in the wave 1 suggest that less elderly were egaged in volunteering in 2015 than in 2006. ??? }} \\



\subsection*{Volunteering v wellbeing - Pearson correlation (Haski) v Kendall-tau correlation}

\footnote{based on PEARSON'S VERSUS SPEARMAN'S AND KENDALL'S CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS FOR CONTINUOUS DATA, Nian Shong Chok, 2008}



Uncondtional means for casp among volunteers and non-volunteers reveal positive associaton between volunteering and wellbeing.  On average volunteers report higher values of casp. Differences between the scores are smaller among  high income coutries. The absolute difference for Denmark  is 0.9, for Switzerland 1.1 and for Greece 2.1, for Portugal 2.4 and for Isreal 2.9. The highest absolute difference of 3.8 is for Poland and the second to the highest is for Estonia (3.6). There are intuitive suggestions that can be postulated from the above graph. The first one is on negative relation between the volunteering rate in a country and its impact on wellbeing. This may be summerized as "more volunteers lower increase in wellbeing". The second postulate is about higher heterogeneity among countries with the low rates. For example the rates in Czech Republic, Portugal and in Estonia are similar but the differences between condtional means are very different. As we see in some countries (Poland, Estonia, Italy, Isreal) the differences in casp are large, while in Czech Republic and Slovenia they are at the same levels as in much richer countries as France, Germany, Luxemburg.

% \source{ }
 \label{fig:oecd_50p}
\caption{volunteering shares}
\end{figure}


In \citet{haski09} association between volunteering and life satisfaction was analysed using the Pearsons correlation coefficient. It should be remembered that casp was not included in the wave 1 that was in that research. Here we analyse relationship between popularity of volunteering and its impact on wellbeing using casp index and Kendall's tau-b correlation coefficients. We use the Kendall's measure since it is appropriate for non-normally distributed data. The Pearson correlation coefficient may be used only for interval data, while the Kendall's correlation coefficients can be used for either ordinal or interval data. According to Khamis  Kendall's tau is more appropriate if at least one variable is ordinal one \footnote{Khamis H. Measures of Association: How to Choose? Journal of Diagnostic Medical Sonography. 2008;24:155-162.}. Also, Kendall's tau is less sensitive to outliers and is often preferred due to its simplicity and ease of interpretation. The Kendall'a tau-b correlation coefficients for association between volunteering and subjective wellbeing  are presented below together with the countries rates of volunteering. They are compared with the results in \citet{haski09}.

[AOK: keep for the time being--will see later what todo]
In all countries volunteering and subjective health are positively associated. The highest association was denoted in Luxemburg (the Kendall's correlation of 18.0\%) and the lowest in Sweden (1.7\%). In Western and Northern Europe the associations are stronger than in Southern and Central Europe but the differences between some countries from both groups are rather small. This suggests that increasing popularity of volunteering in Poland, Czech Republic, Italy or Spain will not necessarily be associated with significant change in subjective health of volunteers. The significance tests for differences between tau(b) are given in the Appendix. According to these tests the difference between Germany and Poland with the corresponding rates of volunteering of 23.8\% and 3.4\% is not statisitically significant. The same we conclude for difference between Germany and Czech Republic where the rate of volunteering is 8.9\%. Other pairs with similar associations between volunteering and health and large differences in popularity of volunteering are: Denmark and Poland, Denmark and Czech Republic, Denmark and Spain, Denmark and Portugal.  \\

As it was expected association between volunteering and CASP  is positive. The Kendall's correlation coefficients range from 15.4\% (Isreal) to 3.3\% (Sweden).  It is intresting that the nonlinear, inverted U-shape relation, is so easily seen. The coefficients for Germany and Belgium are on a similar level as those in Slovenia, Portugal and Spain despite 10 pp. difference in the rates of volunteering. On the other hand the differences in association in Czech Republic on an one side and in Italy and Estonia on another are highly significant (pvalues about 1\%) despite not large differences in the rates. Those results confirm the puzzeling outcome of \citet{haski09} on unexpected pattern of correlations between  popularity of volunteering and wellbeing.  The more recent data from the SHARE survey with more countries, a different measure of volunteering and a different measure of association also show that similar volunteering effect may be observed at the same time in low rate countries (Czech Republic, Greece, Portugal, Slovenia) and in high rate countries (Denmark, Switzeralnd, Belgium, Luxemburg, Germany). From the Fig.2 one should expect the strongest impact in countries with mid-range rates. However, neither the Pearson's correlation  nor the Kendall's correlation coefficients  do not control for confounding variables that may condaminate the realtion between volulnteering and wellbeing. To account for the possible confounding variables we run a regression analysis.   


[AOK: keeping for teh time being may drop]
The puzzeling outcome of \citet{haski09} was unexpected pattern of correlations between  popularity of volunteering and wellbeing.  The more recent data from the SHARE survey with more countries, a different measure of volunteering and a different measure of association confirms that finding - weak volunteering effect is observed among low rate countries (Czech Republic, Greece, Portugal, Slovenia) and among high rate countries (Denmark, Switzeralnd, Belgium, Luxemburg, Germany). Somewhere between the impact is the strongest. \\

Neither the Pearson's correlation nor the Kendall's correlation coefficient  do not control for confounding variables. They just describe unconditional relation betweem volunteering and well-being. To account for the role of possible confounding variables we run a regression analysis.

\subsection*{Volunteering and casp (regression analysis)}

There are different methods how the relation between the rate of volunteering and its impact on wellbeing may be investigated. One aproach is to assume the universal relation between volunteering and wellbeing conditional on the rate of volunteering. In this approach the country effect depends on observed variables and any deviation from conditional expected value is treated as a random event drawn from the same distribution. So, the deviations from the grand average are assumed to be not related to country level variables incuded into the model. \\

Another approach is based on an assumption of the uniqness of each country. The country effect as being seen as the result of different history, cultural factors and institutions is considered to be the unique characteristic of a given country. Here, the estimate of the country effect for one country does not give us any extra information on another one. It means that we may not predict how relation between volunteering and wellbeing will change  after an increase in the country's volunteering rate using the prediction for a different country. This approach is equivalent to fitting a separate model to each country’s dataset:  

 \begin{eqnarray}
	casp_{i,c}= \beta_{0c}+ \beta_{1c}*v_{i,c} + \gamma_{c}*Z_{i,c} + \epsilon_{i,c}
 \end{eqnarray}

where $v_{i,c}$ is a binary variable equal to 1 if a person i from a country c is engaged in  volunteering  and a matrix $Z_{i,c}$ includes controls : age,gender, education measured in years and a country average gdp per capita expressed in purchasing power parity in years X-Y. 


In this model $\beta_{1c}$ measures country-specific impact of volunteering on wellbeing. For each country we get the separate coefficient and any country specific factors are absorbed into the intercept term. No restrictions are assumed on the variance of the error terms for each country. It may be also noticed that any country difference in mean values of wellbeing conditional on volunteering may be presented as \footnote{It is possible since $\bar{casp_{c}} = \bar{\hat{casp_c}}$} 

 \begin{eqnarray}
	\bar{\hat{casp_{c}}}(1)-\bar{\hat{casp_{c}}}(0)= \hat{\beta_{0c}}+\hat{\gamma_{c}}*(\bar{Z}_{c}(1)-\bar{Z}_{c}(0))
 \end{eqnarray}

with $\bar{\hat{casp_{c}}}(1)$ being a predicted average wellbeing for a volunteer and $\bar{\hat{casp_{c}}}(0)$ is a predicted average wellbeing for a non-volunteer.  The first term gives an impact of volunteering in country c. The second term is an endowment effect due to  differences in covariates between volunteers and non volunteers with $\bar{Z}_{c}(1)$ being average endowment among volunteers and $\bar{Z}_{c}(0)$ among non-volunteers. Thought characteristcs allocated to both sectors may be different they are valued exactly in the same way $\gamma$. The results of estimation are given in the Appendix. Below we present a graph showing the estimated volunteering effects ($ hat{\beta_{0c}} $) and the endowmemt effects $(\hat{\gamma_{c}}*(\bar{Z}_{c}(1)-\bar{Z}_{c}(0)))$

In all countries the volunteering effect is positive except Denamark where it is not statistically signifcant from 0. The highest estmiated values are for Italy, Greece, Isreal and Poland. The smallest for rich countries - Denmark, Switzerland, Luxemburg, Sweden but also for Czech Rep. Controlling for covariates such as age, gender, education and economic development lowers realtive importance of volunteering in Poland and Estonia and increasing it in Italy, Greece, Spain, Isreal. It is intresting that in two formerly communistic countries selection into volunteering is more important than in Southern European countries. \textit{(Interpretation): It means that engaging in volunteering adds reltively less to wellbeing in CEE coutries than in Southern ones. Volunteers in CEEs are more selected from those who were high level of wellbeing even without engaging in volunteering. So, even though the fixed effect approach generally does not allow for inter-country comparisons we may suggest that some consistent regional differences exist in Europe with Poland and Estonia being separate group than Southern European countries.} \\

As it was explained above, an alternative approach is to assume comparability among countries. It means that we belive in common trends among countries and treat deviations from them as being randomly. One possible formulation of a model is a multilevel linear regression with varying intercept and coefficient. By allowing for a random intercept for each country we allow for different values for wellbeing within a country by gender, age and other control variables. At the same time we allow for a variation in averages between countries:


 \begin{eqnarray}
	casp_{i,c}\sim N(\beta_{0}+ u_{c} +  \beta_{1,c} * vol_{i,c}+\gamma*Z_{i,c},\sigma^{2}_{y}) \\	
	u_{c} \sim N(\gamma_{c},\sigma^{2}_{c}) \\
	\beta_{1,c} \sim N(\gamma_{r}*r_{c},\sigma^{2}_{r})
 \end{eqnarray}
       
with $\hat{casp_{i,c}(1)}$ being average casp of volunteers and $  \hat{casp_{i,c}(0)}$ of those not engaged in it. The first term - volunteering effect - measures an impact of volunteering as function of country popularity of it assuming the same average values for controls. The second term - endowment effect - describes imapct of differences in controls between volunteers and non volunteers. One can also calculate a partiall effect of volunteering country rate on casp.  \\   
 
where $r_{c}$ is a country volunteering rate calculted from the wave 6 of the SHARE survey. In this model we treat country effect as being random effect and we allow for impact of volunteering to depend on the rate of volunteering. Since we estimate one model for all countries we cannot decompose the mean difference in well being withour error. The full estimation results are given in the Appendix.

Interpretion ? (What can we say ? Results are very different. Pooling suggests that volunteers are better off becouse they have better characteristics. It is not voluteering make them more satisfied but rather they are volunteers becouse they are more satified. Volunteering is more important when it is not very popular. When the volunteering is very popular it is possible for volunteering to lower wellbeing. Why ? It may be that you are socially forced to do that and you do not enjoy it. Separate models give different impression. Country differences are much more evident. VOlunteering is more important than it was suggested by the previous model. Better people select into volunteering but also, despite their previleged characteristics, they get extra wellbeing from volunteering. )//

\section{Discussion}


The positive consequences of being engaged in volunteering by elderly are well known and commonly accepted. Volunteering is important and it needs to be study in details.  According to OECD estimates the value of unpaid volunteering ranges from X\% of GDP to as much as Y\% (OECD, yyyy).  Demographic changes combined with progress in health care add to increasing time while people are in relatively good health while being on retirement. This creates additional  stock of unused labor among elderly that may be effectively used with benefit for volunteer and other members of a society.  It makes   volunteering of elderly to be potentially important policy tool that may help to keep people in better health when they get older. \\


Casual realtion between volunteering  and health or wellbeing is not obvious. Volunteering may improve the employability of volunteers and it provides engagement in a socially meaningful role  what could positively impact on health and well-being. Volunteering might builts up social networks and gives meaning and purpose in life. (przepisana, zmodyfikowane) //

The question that must be asked is whether popularization of volunteering should be put into social policy agenda. Taking into consideration our results we expect different answers in different countries. It is possible that in some rich and highly developed countries volunteering is so popular and treated as so usuall activity that it adds only marginally to individuals' wellbeing.
